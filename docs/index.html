== Distinguishing markup and code mode <section1>

Distinguishing between *markup* and *code* mode (not 
to forget _math_) is not as easy as one would think. 
#[
  Especially since they can be
  #{
    "nested"
    [
      _and nested_
      #{
        "and even more"
        [
          *nested*. 
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
Basically, Typst code consists of three languages. And 
you can go from each language to each other language 
by using all kinds of
#let parentheses = ("()", "[]", "{}")
In order to parse the code properly, we need to do 
_balanced matching_ for these #parentheses. The problem
is that #regex() is not good at doing recursive things. 

This is why the recursion depth is _*limited*_. 


== Code mode

After we enter code mode, which is quite tricky as we
saw in section @section1, syntax highlighting looks 
quite different. 

There are
#{
  let lengths = (1pt, 1fr, -2, 1em, 3deg, 0in, 9cm, 0rad, 100%, 1mm)
  [and]
  let numbers = (1.2, 2e9, -3.0003e99, 0xFF, 0b100201, 0o337, )
}


When in markup mode, certain keywords change the 
context to code mode for the entire line

#import "@preview/conchord:0.2.0" as con
#import emoji: face

#let x = range(0, 10)

Test some important cases

We have #emoji.wave and #data.rev()
#if true [
  *yes*
] else [ // this is a bug but it's tough to fix
  noe
]

#let my-func(a: 1pt, b, c) = {
  if true {
    return false
  }
  
  return $ a + b $
}

#show heading: it => {
  it * 2
}
#show math.equation.where(block: true): it => {}
#show math.equation: it => {}
#show: template
#show  : template
#set text(..) if a == b

if k==l // obviously no code
== Markup mode

All escaped symbols, like \@, \{, \} etc. are noticed! 
The same holds for line/equation breaks \

#set text(2em, red)
#show math.equation(numbering: "(1)")

#hide[_hidden_]

#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, 1fr),
  $A$, $B$, $C$,
  // note: here lurks a recursion limit for () pairs
  ..range(20).map(i => str(2*(i+1))) 
)

An example from the Typst documentation
$ A = pi r^2 $
$ "area" = pi dot "radius"^2 $
$ cal(A) :=
    { x in RR | x "is natural" } $
#let x = 5
$ #x < 17 qt.eq gt.e $ // single-character symbols are not recognized

- a
- b ~ a --- as \u{1f600} \$1.50! \u{1f600}

`asd`

```typ
raw text // asd ) #{asd + 3}
```
// hard to detect then end of a context expression with regex:
#context locate(<back>).position() 
#dictionary(sys).at("version")

$
  [| |] || := ::= ... =: != >> >= >>> << <= <<<
  -> |-> => |=> ==> --> ~~> ~> >-> ->> <- <== 
  <-- <~~ <~ <-< <<- <-> <=> <==> <-->/
$
#"text"

#while n < 10 {
  n = (n * 2) - 1
  (n,)
}
#{
  #k[]
}
#let func() ={
  v(2cm)
  pad(x: 8%)[
    #abstract
  ]
  pagebreak[2pt]
}
  


#(23+
23)
#let p = ("a", "k")
#(21)
#let p = ("a", "k")
21
#let pd = "a"
12

== Equations <equations>

$ 
  c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 \ 
    c &= plus.minus sqrt(a^2 + b^2) 
$

#[
  $ a + x + b $
  $ a + #place([]) x + #b $
]


Switching to content mode within equations is currently
not supported: $#box[*2*]$


== Modes and comments

Due to matching rules, it is tricky to get comments and 
switched language modes to work. Let's check some cases
#{
  // We have entered code mode
  let verification = "Is this parsed as code?"
  table(
    columns: 2, // we're still in code mode, the "2" is an int
  )
  let /*really bad practice*/ x = 2pt
  [
    // Back in markup mode
    #hide()
    let // <- not a keyword
  ]
  [/**/ #hide[]]
}
#table(
  columns: 2, // we're now in code mode, the "2" is an int
)

#let url = "https://another.edge/case" // sometimes "tricky"


This is not simplified

#asd()</code></pre>
